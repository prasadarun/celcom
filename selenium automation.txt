Selenium notes

1.Tools required for automation
a.Eclipse 
b.Java jdk 
c.selenium jar file

2.What is the class?
A class is a group of objects created for common properties.It is like a blue print 
a class can contains fields, methods,constructures,interface

3.What is object ?
Creating the intance for class inorder to access the properties of class
An entity that has state and behaviour is called object

ex: class prasad{

int a = 10;                  // State for object

  public void printname(){   // Behaviour for object
  system.out.print("Hi my name is prasad");
   }

 public static void main(String[] args){
 prasad obj = new prasad();
 obj.printname();  //  object
   }

 }

Note: In one class we should have multiple same objects

4.What is method?
It is a collection of statements grouped together to peform actions
Note: Methods may have return or void type

ex: class prasad{

public void add(){    // void method
 int a = 10;
 int b = 12;
 int c ;
 System.out.print("c: "+c);
 }
 
 public int add1(){    // return  type int 
 int a = 10;
 int b = 12;
 int c =  a+b;
 return c;
 
 }

}


5.What is constructor?
Constructer is the special type of method used to intialise the object

Conditions to create constructor
a.constructor name should be same as class name
b.constructor should not have return or void type

Types of contructors
a.default constructor
b.Constructor with arguments


6.What is interface?
The interface is the blueprint of the class

Uses of interface?
a.we use interface for abstraction
b. By interface we can support the multiple inheritance


7.What is webdriver?
It a API which is used to get response to get automate web application

It supports chrome,firefox,intyernet explorer, safari etc

Disadvantage of webdriver
We cannot work on windows base application


The dependicies required for maveen frame work is:
1.slenium dependency - To get it go to google and type webdriver selenium then you can find the depencies in loaded page
2.TestNG  dependency - To get it go to google and type testNG maveen you will get it and after downloaded testNg we need to change the scope to "test"
3.Apache poi - To get it same procedure repeats
